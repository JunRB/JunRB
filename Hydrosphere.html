<h2 style="color:Navy;"><b><u>Different parts of the water cycle</b></u></h2>
<p>The water moves from one reserve to another such as from a river to the ocean or from the ocean to the atmosphere <br>
by the physical processes of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, surface runoff, and subsurface <br>
flow. In doing so, the water goes through different forms such as liquid, solid and gas/vapour.</p>

<h2 style="color:Navy;"><b><u>The Water Cycle Explained</u></b></h2>
<p>The water cycled when evaporations from the surface of the earth, rises into the atmosphere,<br>
 cools and condenses into rain or snow in clouds, and falls again to the surface as precipitation.<br>
 The water cycle is important because it is how water reaches plants, animals and us! Besides providing<br>
 people, animals and plants with water.</p>
 
 <h2 style="color:Navy;"><b><u>Compare the amount of water found on ONE other planet to what is found on Earth. What makes Earth different and special?</u></b></h2>
 
 <p>71% of the Earths surface is covered in water, but only 0.8% of the water on the Earths surface is<br>
 actually fresh drinkable water, Ground water is 1.7%, Ice caps, Glaciers and Permanent snow contain 1.7%<br>
 and Oceans, Seas and Bays contain a whopping 96% of the Earths Water source. Mars only has 14% of its surface<br>
 as water but most of is ice. Scientists say about 4 billion years ago Mars was like Earth and the water covered <br>
 most of its surface. The Earth is special because without water we would not be able to live.</p>
