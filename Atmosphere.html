<h2 style="font-size:200%;"><b><u>The Carbon Cycle</b></u></h2>

<h2><b><u>Physical Processes:</u></b></h2>
<p>Dead Living things get washed into rivers and streams, water currents take the carbon it contains around the oceans.
The carbon can then settle to the ocean floor or to the ground.

<h2><b><u>Biological Process:</u></b></h2>
<h3><b>Respiration:</b></h2>
<p>All living things respire talking in oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide.</p>

<h3><b>Photosynthesis:</b></h3>
<p>All plants are producers which use sunlight and carbon dioxide to make sugar and oxygen</p>

<h3><b>Decomposition and Decay:</h3></b>
<p>The breaking down and decay of living organisms can create methane gas as a by-product of the bacteria or fungi that are eating the dead living organism.</p>

<h2><u><b>Chemical Processes:</u></b></h2>
<h3><b>Combustion</h3></b>
<p>When wood or other hydrocarbons like oil, gas or coal are burnt in oxygen they all produce carbon dioxide.</p>
<h3><b>Dissolving into Carbonic Acid:</h3></b>
<p>Cardon dioxide can react with water to form carbonic acid, this process can also reverse to release carbon dioxide from the ocean.</p>
<h3><b>Limewater</b></h3>
<p>Lime water is water with calcium hydroxide mixed </p>
<p>The carbon dioxide reacts with the water becoming carbonic acid.</p>
<p>The carbonic acid reacts with the calcium to form calcium carbonate</p>

<h2 style="font-size:200%;"><b><u>Carbon Process</u></b></h2>
<p>The water cycled when evaporations from the surface of the earth, rises into the atmosphere, cools and condenses <br>
into rain or snow in clouds, and falls again to the surface as precipitation. The water cycle is important because it<br>
is how water reaches plants, animals and us! Besides providing people, animals and plants with water.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:200%;"><b><u>Compare the amount of carbon found on ONE other planet to what is found on Earth. What makes Earth different and special?(MARS)</u></b></h2>
<p>Earth only has 0.04% of its atmosphere as carbon dioxide compared to Marsâ€™s 95%. This is what makes the Earth so <br>
unique and special if most of our atmosphere contained carbon do you think we would be able to live? Of course not, <br>
if we were to live in such an environment we would die. That is why we should be taking care of our environment around <br>
us so that we could live in a good environment.</p>
